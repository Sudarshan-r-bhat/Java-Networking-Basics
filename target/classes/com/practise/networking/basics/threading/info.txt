<<Multiple programs are stacked in here.
So this program might seem lengthy,
So please read the entire program.>>

    note:   FileInputStream == 1 Byte [used to read file byte by byte]
            DataInputStream == 8 Bytes [used to read java primitives like int, float, double...]

            InputStreamReader == [ used to read characters from InputStream of bytes]
            BufferedInputStream == [used to buffer the bytes]

            BufferedReader    ==  [used to buffer the characters not bytes]
            FileReader        == [reads Characters instead of bytes. each character may be > 1 Byte]

PrintWriter : takes both streams and files as its input. as it acts as both streams and readers.

   conclusion:  streams         : read bytes of data.
                reader          : read characters of data.
                streamReader    : its the mix, it takes streams as argument and reads characters.
                objectReader    : reads objects.
